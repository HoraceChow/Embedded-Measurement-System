# Embedded-Measurement_System

## Description 
Developed an embedded measurement system that scans surrounding quickly, and reconstruct an accurate graphical representation of the environment.

## How it is built
The measurement system requires a couple hardware component, MSP432E401Y MicroController, VL53L1X Time of Flight sensor, and a stepper motor. The microcontroller is programmed with C and assembly.

## Files
* Excel dataset - Measured data point and exported from microcontroller
* Main.py - Python code for generating the graphical environment 
* MicroController_Code - contains all necessary files for microcontroller
